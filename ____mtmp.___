## Make file template
## Lines starting with two ## are comments
## While lines starting with a single # are preprocessor stuff
## Everything is processed line by line with whitespace preservation
##
## #ifdef <define>			Is whatever defined?
## #ifndef <define>			Is whatever not defined?
##
## Have fun!
