# Extended Generic Sector Mappings
# Without this, RMD_EGSL is quite useless.
# Although you can change the data here you will not produce the desired result
# if you expect types to do other things. What I mean is that if you were to say
# change the door trigger to another number, it would be of another type. So
# this file is for internal usage for the most part.
# So, avoid changing this file since the primary purpose is to make the code
# in p_spec.c extendable and lightweight and without having over 9000 if
# statements with the lines to match.
