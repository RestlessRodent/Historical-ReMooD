========[ FAQ ]================================================================
===============================================================================

 Q: I am playing on DOS and ReMooD crashed, now my screen is messed up.
 A: If the game crashes the screen mode cannot be restored, therefor you must
    type in "MODE CO80" which will set a color 80x25 mode.
   
 Q: The framerate suffers in certain areas.
 A: Try turning off decals, disabling transparency effects (including the
    transparent status bar), and possibly decrease the screen size. You can
    also try switching to a lower resolution. 320x200 will render the fastest
    at the cost of view quality.
 
 Q: The sound skips when playing the game normally.
 A: Try increasing the sound buffer size to a higher number, this will require
    less sound updates. However, it may delay sound a bit depending on how high
    the value is.
   
 Q: Sounds are delayed
 A: The sound buffer size is too large, try lowering the value to a reasonable
    amount.
    
 Q: I want the game to be aspect ratio correct, how do I do that?
 A: ReMooD always assumes a 4:3 aspect ratio. That is, the game will be aspect
    correct provided you choose a resolution that fits your entire screen for
    the correct ratio that you want. If you have a 1:1 screen (such as a LCD
    panel) then choose 320x240 or 640x480. Otherwise if you have a 4:3 screen
    (such as most CRTs) then choose 320x200 or 640x400. This of course presumes
    you are playing the game fullscreen.
 
 Q: I'm playing on my laptop and sometimes the Doom Guy randomly moves his
    position, but he only does it when I move my laptop.
 A: Your laptop may have an accelerometer which may be exposed to the system
    as a joystick. An example would be the "ST LIS3LV02DL Accelerometer" on my
    laptop for example. It usually is best to not use an accelerometer as a
    joystick unless you want to play by tossing your laptop across a room.

========[ ALLEGRO SPECIFICS ]==================================================
===============================================================================

When using the Allegro interface, there a few things you need to know. If you
are on a UNIX based system you should have a .allegrorc file in your home
directory which is for settings the game will use when things are autodetected.
This is mostly the case for music and sound, if Allegro incorrectly chooses the
wrong sound card you want to use (ALSA, OSS, etc.).

If on Linux and you notice you have no music at all, you may try adding the
following to your .allegrorc:

 > [sound]
 > midi_card = DIGI
 > patches = /home/steven/digmid.dat

This is is the DIGMIDI driver, which essentialy loads instruments from the dat
file printed there. DIGMIDI is like Timidity++ and FluidSynth. You can find
some Allegro patches available at http://alleg.sourceforge.net/digmid.html at
the bottom of the page.  Note that the patches field will vary from system to
system (if you are using Linux you should be knowledgable enough to know what
to put here).

========[ SOURCE CODE STYLE ]==================================================

If you want to submit patches (which I will take a look at and determine their
coolness factor), you must match my coding style. If you didn't then your patch
will be applied ran through GNU indent:

 * indent -kr -bad -bap -c60 -bl -bli0 -nce -cdw -cli4 -cbi0 -nss -npcs -ncs\
          -nprs -saf -sai -nsaw -di1 -nbc -nbfda -nbfde -bls -blf -i4 -lp\
          -l160 -nbbo -ts4 -sob
