========[ ALLEGRO SPECIFICS ]==================================================
===============================================================================

When using the Allegro interface, there a few things you need to know. If you
are on a UNIX based system you should have a .allegrorc file in your home
directory which is for settings the game will use when things are autodetected.
This is mostly the case for music and sound, if Allegro incorrectly chooses the
wrong sound card you want to use (ALSA, OSS, etc.).

If on Linux and you notice you have no music at all, you may try adding the
following to your .allegrorc:

 > [sound]
 > midi_card = DIGI
 > patches = /home/steven/digmid.dat

This is is the DIGMIDI driver, which essentialy loads instruments from the dat
file printed there. DIGMIDI is like Timidity++ and FluidSynth. You can find
some Allegro patches available at http://alleg.sourceforge.net/digmid.html at
the bottom of the page.  Note that the patches field will vary from system to
system (if you are using Linux you should be knowledgable enough to know what
to put here).
