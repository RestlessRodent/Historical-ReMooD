 Legacy Experience with new features and more stability.

#### BEGIN ACTUAL TODO LIST ###################################################

These are the following things that need to be done to progress: When done
mark as completed, too bad there is no ASCII checkmark.

 * f_finale:	RMODize the code or use another special proprietary format to
				define the finale cast.

 * v_widget:	Rework the widget code, it sucks. Although it can be expanded it
 				has just turned into a huge contorted mess of object oriented
 				C. Would still have to do OO C but it can be done alot cleaner
 				than what is already here.
 
 * v_video:		Add back support for characters with accents and such along with
 				other international characters.
 
 * v_video:		Make the patch drawing functions in the image code actually
 				secure so someone won't crash the game with a badly malformed
 				patch.
 
 * v_video:		Add support for tall patches to be drawn.
 
 * makefile:	Add back WAD building to the makefile and make it mandatory and
 				dependable so you don't have to wad/makewad.sh. Would also have
 				to make it work on MSVC too.
 
 * remootex:	Rewrite the old crusty program that was basically a proof of
 				concept into something much more reliable and better.
 
 * t_*:			Implement the ReMooD Virtual Machine (big undertaking).
 
 * p_spec/intr:	Make line triggers and sector specials dynamic in RMOD so that
 				pages and pages of switch statements are removed.
 
 * sounds:		Fix the sound code for WL and add support for SNDINFO or another
 				similar format. (Needed for Hexen anyway)
 
 * w_wad:		Remove the old W_ and WX_ code, it is very old.
 
 * p_info:		Remove the old info interface and use the new one, which is
 				much better and more dynamic. Also, implement the remaining
 				stuff needed to parse info on a level.
 
 * m_cheat:		Rewrite the cheat subsystem and possibly RMOD it so that any
 				cheats done are not a huge mess. Could also add a single cheat
 				command that can access all cheats ("cheats list" anyone?).
 
 * d_prof:		Rewrite the profile subsystem and make it so it isn't a giant
 				old console code hack. It should be better and independent along
 				with the ability to be placed in new config files and to have it
 				transferrable over the net. Also, make per player configs and
 				key binds along with alternative configs (such as when playing
 				with someone else) and if two players share the same keys, then
 				show a list of conflicts so they don't screw each other over.
 
 * m_menu:		Rewrite the drawing stuff so it is much better, with the super
 				new widget code.
 
 * command:		Remove all this junk.
 
 * console:		Move all the variables to the new system.
 
 * g_*,p_*:		Make game settings semi-console bound but not exactly console
 				bound, this way demos and such along with network environments
 				will work without much trouble here.
 
 * g_state:		Merge this file into something else, it virtually has nothing
 				here and just holds game state defines for some reason.
 
 * info:		RMODize everything.
 
 * md5:			Use a better algorithm?
 
 * p_mobj:		Make per object P_Random() and possibly map based P_Random().
 				Fully synced for synced games and per object/thinker for async
 				games.
 
 * p_chex:		Make this an internal DeHackEd Patch and put it in remood.wad.
 
 * g_input:		Delete the way normal input is done and do it a profile way so
 				that there are no more console variables that define keys.
 
 * dehacked:	RMODize this to make it fit with RMOD and not be so constant.
 
 * p_???:		Make P_CheckSight() stop at 3D floors.
 
 * *:			Remove all that demoversion < > <= >= junk and just make them
 				all game varaibles (so one could easily support old demos or
 				possibly even record older demos -complevel).
 
 * p_???:		Fixup Vanilla and older Legacy Demo suports so the ancient
 				demos play.
 
 * d_eng/frn:	Remove these language files, will be replaced by the stuff in
 				dstrings for internationalization.
 
 * p_fab:		Remove this file and put the stuff elsewhere.
 
 * p_*:			Merge all the door, specials, plats, etc. code into a single
 				RMOD possibly source and make it event based so that less code
 				does more things.
 
 * w_*,z_,*:	For any WL_ data use special allocation tags for anything that
 				creates "ordered" data, this way it can also be freed after the
 				initial free in case there was any misses.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

in r_splats.c, make wallsplats a dynamic array instead of a static one of size
MAXLEVELSPLATS. This way, global memory space is reduced potentially and the
game memory can be managed better.

ReMooD Doom Script Virtual Machine, for execution of virtual code.

Use extended Legacy Script syntax, but mostly syntactically compatible. First
tokenize an entire script with includes into a structure element as followed:

struct
{
	TokenType_t TokenType;				// Type of token (ident., number, etc.)
	uint8_t* TokenPtr;					// Pointer to token
	size_t TokenSize;					// Size of token
};

Then after that, create scope zones for scopes and paranthesis. So essentially

script 10 { print ( "Hello world!" ) ; playeraddfrag ( player ( trigger ) ) ;
if ( playergetfrag ( player ( trigger ) ) == 2 + 2 ) { print (
"You now have 4 frags!" ) ; } } 

Would become

script 10
	__BEGIN_SCOPE
	print
		__BEGIN_PAR
		"Hello world!"
		__END_STATEMENT
		__END_PAR
	__END_STATEMENT
	playeraddfrag
		__BEGIN_PAR
		player
			__BEGIN_PAR
				trigger
				__END_STATEMENT
			__END_PAR
		__END_PAR
		__END_STATEMENT
	__END_STATEMENT
	if
		__BEGIN_PAR
		playergetfrag
			__BEGIN_PAR
			player
				__BEGIN_PAR
				trigger
				__END_PAR
				__END_STATEMENT
			__END_PAR
			__END_STATEMENT
		==
		2
		+
		2
		__END_PAR
		__END_STATEMENT
	__END_STATEMENT
		__BEGIN_SCOPE
			print
				__BEGIN_PAR
				"You now have 4 frags!"
				__END_PAR
				__END_STATEMENT
			__END_STATEMENT
		__END_SCOPE
	__END_SCOPE

Statements contain actual code. When a statement executes it returns something
logically speaking. The deepest statements and scopes are done first, then it
branches out to the lower ones.

For all case and purposes, { and } are treated as if they were ; on statement
boundaries.
