ReMooD is a source port of the popular game Doom based on Doom Legacy 1.42 and
aims to provide a similar experience yet enhanced and much more stable. It is
licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 3 (or at your option any
later version).

## Compatibility

### With Doom Legacy

Doom Legacy versions between 1.11 and 1.42 should be fully supported.

### With ReMooD

The only available compatibility is with ReMooD 0.8a.

## Command Line and System Usage

### WAD File Directories

Directories which contain WAD files may be shared between various other source
ports which support said feature.

 * Environment Variable `DOOMWADDIR`: A single directory.
 * Environment Variable `DOOMWADPATH`: A `PATH`-like setting (on UNIX fields
   are split by `:` while on Windows it is split by `;`, this may vary for
   other operating systems) which contains multiple directories.

ReMooD itself has the following along with the above:

 * Command-Line Switch `-doomwaddir`: A single directory.
 * Command-Line Switch `-doomwadpath`: A `PATH`-like setting listing multiple
   directories.
 * Java System Property `org.remood.wad.dir`: A single directory.
 * Java System Property `org.remood.wad.path`: A `PATH`-like setting listing
   multiple directories.

## Building

You require a Java 8 development environment.

You have two choices for building:

 * Apache Ant
 * Eclipse (Requires 4.3 or later)

### Apache Ant

You can type `ant jar` which will build the JAR. The default rule is to build
the JAR then run ReMooD.

Out of tree builds are supported.

### Eclipse

You can import this directory as a project into your workspace.

Note that I personally do not use Eclipse so during active development the
Eclipse project may be out of date.
