And the month that I have decided to continue working on ReMooD has arrived.
Over time I have been thinking of going the slow adaptation route potentially.
That is, I have a libremood.so which a Java interface over it. Then over time
I eventually move more and more things over into Java land. Doing it this way
might end up being easier in the long run and I would have an actually runnable
game instead of just porting everything other slowly.

Actually this will complicate things greatly and would end up being very
boilerplated.

It might be better in the long run to have separated JARs that are merged in
the end. So for example the core stuff such as the console and WAD code would
be in its own project. Then stuff such as level handling would be in another.
Then the complete remood.jar will just be a merger of all sub-jars. Then I can
have some kind of separation and not have to recompile the entire thing over
and over again.
