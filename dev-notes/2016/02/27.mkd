If I made the core of ReMooD compatible with CLDC 8 then that would mean that
ReMooD could run on mobile devices. That however would mean that I cannot use
lambdas and some classes would be missing. However, from a logical perspective
it can work out. Lambdas and method handles are not truly needed. I also would
not be able to use reflection either, but other than scripting I do not see
a real need for reflection.
