I need to decouple and not use AWT/Swing in core classes at all because that
can get messy and break portability.

Thinking about it, technically the main game and such is launched from the
main menu which is a sort of launcher. In C, the game is just highly coupled
while in Java it would be more sane to have a launcher interface (such as one
like Doom 95) which then spawns individual games. Minecraft does this. With
a slight decouple of the rendering engine and the gameplay engine, there can
be three distinct parts: The launcher (title screen), gameplay, and the
renderer. Then ReMooD could be used as a sort of library to play the game.
