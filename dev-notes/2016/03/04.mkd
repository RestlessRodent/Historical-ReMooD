One thing which will take awhile is translation of all the game settings
which are available in ReMooD, due to the requirements of having
a compatible source port (one which can replace Doom Legacy).

## 16:27

There are 161 individual settings. The one setting I am not going to translate
is PGS_COENABLESLOPES, I will just remove that completely since it is complex
and never worked anyway. I do not really have any intention to support slopes,
at least initially.

## 16:45

I will have to have default sets for various missions (such as Final Doom).
