When playing a game, perhaps in multiplayer, it could be detected if the IWAD
is at least somewhat compatible. That is if you are playing D5M1 and the server
uses _doom2.wad_, then you could join with say _tnt.wad_ or _plutonia.wad_.
If the game is not compatible then the player will just desync out.
