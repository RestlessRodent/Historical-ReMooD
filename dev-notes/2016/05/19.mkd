Use `SetByteArrayRegion` instead of `byte[]` to `uint8_t*` with
`GetByteArrayElements`/`ReleaseByteArrayElements`.

I suppose when it comes to player selection (which screen they control) I can
have something similar to Quake 3 on the Dreamcast. Basically moving mice and
keyboards to the player to play as when setting up a game. Or alternatively
something similar to what I was doing before, but have it intelligent so to
speak. It has to be easy in a way though, does Player 1 always get the
keyboard and mouse or can they also get a Joystick too? Or can an alternative
player use the keyboard and mouse?
