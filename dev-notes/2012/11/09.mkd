Still working on ReMooD. As of currently I rewrote the REMOODAT code, so now
it runs better not to mention ReMooD starts in seconds rather than minutes
now. WADs are opened faster (the speed penalty was due to the checksum being
calculated on the WAD, but it did it in an innefficient matter. Fixed a crash
when playing on a system with no sound card and also a crash related to
switching to an unsupported video mode. Basic Menus, they need to be populated
with options and permit access to hidden features. Basic gameplay, you can
join the game and run around, kill things, etc. but there's not much to
setting up a real game yet. Basic OpenGL Support, it is currently just
experimental. Spectators, you can watch a game and move around, but once you
join the game you cannot go back to spectating as of this writing. A
scoreboard, which is the same as the intermission screen.
