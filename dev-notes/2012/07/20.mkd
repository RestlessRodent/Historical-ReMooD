Since my last update, i have switched from C to C++. However it is not a full
blown rewrite, just anything new I write might be full of C++ stuff. I am
avoiding templates and STL in the interest of speed, since the code base is
still pretty much in C it will not make much difference anyway. The switch was
mostly done for convenience, certain sections of the code are much easier to
read and work smoother. I was also able to remove some duplicate code that did
not need to be duplicated everywhere.

On other things, I have worked on demo support, so ReMooD is capable of
playing certain demo kinds, although they usually desync due to
incompatibilities.

In other news, I have a job now so I will not be able to work on ReMooD much
since it is very busy. I know I promised to hopefully make a July or August
release but I do not have much days being off to work on ReMooD, so currently
when ReMooD comes out it comes out. I will set up automated builds in the
future sometime after a few things are completed so that you could run the
game.
