Since my last posting I have made a bunch of updates, there are now workable
menus (although you need the console to access some of them). Each player can
have its own menu to control (per player menus). I moved virtually all the
game state variables to the new variable system and it works quite well. I did
not make much progress in the save game or netcode areas though (the netcode
needs some re-factoring before I go further with it). The intermission screen
looks much nicer. Textures and floors are now animated with ANIMATED along
with SWITCHES for switch textures. Generalized LineDefs and Sector Types for
somewhat customized line def types for internal usage. I started base work on
a script interpreter and compiler for faster and hopefully cleaner script
execution. A basic Legacy-like status bar overlay (the standard Doom bar is
not yet implemented). An improved hash function. I added MiniZ into the game
but it is not yet used, so this would pave the way for compression and stuff
like PNG output rather than PCX.

I am currently working on demo support so you can play back and record various
demo types. I entitled the demo support backend as "Demo Factories" which
basically can encode and decode demos at the same time. As of this writing you
can play back Vanilla demos (and record them), but they pretty much instantly
desync which is being worked on. However in the mean time I'm currently adding
Legacy demo support so you could play old Legacy demos better than Legacy
itself, provided you did not open the menu while recording a demo in Legacy.

I also started base work on Heretic support so the maps load without problems
and most of the line and sector types work, however there are no map things,
weapons, or inventory objects. I'll need to add support for those.

In the end, menus will be mostly independent but glued together. I need to
implement per player automaps however. The profile system also needs to be
able to be modified with loading/saving of profiles.
