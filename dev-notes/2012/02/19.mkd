Just as an update to the previous posting, the renderer issues have been
fixed. The messed up textures were due to applying patch offsets to drawing,
when they are never considered, there was also a counting error which was
fixed also. And along with the slime trails across every sector (floor
bleeding), that was related to the wrong sectors being chosen for the seg
sides.
