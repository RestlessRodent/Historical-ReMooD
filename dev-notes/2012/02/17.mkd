ReMooD can load levels now somewhat although walls and floors have no activity
and there is no block map (no collisions). Both Doom and Hexen format maps are
supported and can be loaded by the game. Support for textual map formats (such
as UDMF) will come at a later time.

There also exists new texture loading code that unifies wall and floor
textures. This means that it is possible to use flats as wall textures and
wall textures as flats.

Level loading takes some time, but this is due to unoptimized WAD reading
code. Most of the time spent loading levels is accessing data from a WAD. Data
loading can be improved later with buffered reading rather than the current
slow method.
