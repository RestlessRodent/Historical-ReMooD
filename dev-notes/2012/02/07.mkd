As of this posting, ReMooD's new console is in place and is ready and waiting
to take over console based functions. The new code appears to be more
efficient and replaces the existing console code (which is of questionable
legal status). The old deprecated console code will remain until everything is
moved over to the new system. Below is a screenshot of what the new console
looks like, not much different from the old one. There's also a change in
where ReMooD places its configuration files (mostly affects UNIX users), on
UNIX systems it uses the XDG specifications (a.k.a. "~/.config" and
"~/.local/share".

The formerly called ReMooD Map Object Data now called ReMooD Data is supported
and parsed, but only menus are handled so far. However, due to security
concerns you are not able to replace menus in PWADs unless you modify
remood.wad and remove the write-over lock. But in spite of this, you are
allowed to replace the "PWAD Menu" which would be the place where user WADs
could add their own menu stuff.

There also exists the new imaging system (you can see it below). It handles
both the internal patch\_t and pic\_t formats. If you edit for Doom you are
probably familiar with patch\_t already, pic\_t is similar however it was
created by Doom Legacy. However, patches are not directly drawn to the screen
currently and are translated internally to another format. Thus, you get the
image on a black rectangle.
