I've been silently working on ReMooD for the past two months, sorry about not
posting any updates. Although work is slow (due to my job), the changes are
plentiful. One major note if you read the last news posting is that I switched
from C to C+++, well I went back to C. In the end I figured the switch to C++
was not worth it. Increased code complexity, longer compile times, the ability
to no longer reliably static link, lack of C++ on some platforms, lack of C++
standard on certail platforms. I've always been comfortable working in C
however so it will make coding a bit easier for me, rather than beutifying all
the code into C++ when there is no real point to it. There was a one month gap
of no development happening before I went back to C, and once I switched back
development shot off.

Major changes would be, highlighted in bold and notes in parenthesis:
**Simpler identifiers in the code** (this means there are no more 30 character
typedefs and what not so it should be easier on the eyes); **Profiles are now
supported again** (and their settings are saved, although currently rather
cheaply, needs improvement); **Improved the timing code** (the game should run
closer to the standard frame rate now); **Client/Server Networking support**
(although it desyncs if you are not on the same type of system as the host and
if your game options are not the same); **Joystick Support** (you can play
with up to 3 other friends in the same game now and you can join them in via
the sticks too)

Minor changes would be: **Mouse Button Support** (i.e. mouse buttons now do
something rather than nothing); **Improved socket code** (the old code was a
huge mess); **Improved block stream performance** (Block streamers work faster
now); **WAD loader bottlenecks reduced** (it will no longer take forever to
load a simple WAD); **Basic Demo Support** (you can record and play back a
demo, but it will most likely desync); **Transition to support Heretic**
(converting some of the old data tables and code into the new format);
**Improved split screen code** (works much better now and is much cleaner);
**Even drawing of patches** (the graphics are no longer jiggly when you are
playing on a resolution above 320x200); **Intermission screen with counting
up** (The new-style scoreboard but one where all the numbers count up like the
standard Doom one); **OSS MIDI Support** (if you have a /dev/midi or whatever,
you can listen to MIDI music)

As of this writing my current work includes improving the ReMooD Data loader
(contains all the object data). It currently is much faster and instead of the
game taking 5 minutes to load it is much much less than that. I am also
working on an auto build system located at <http://remood.org:10080/>, so once
this is up and running you'll be able to download bleeding edge ReMooD and
test it out.

No real screenshots to show anything new and whatnot since most of the changes
that were made are under the hood.
