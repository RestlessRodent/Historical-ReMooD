As of this writing, I have implemented custom Weapons and Ammo support into
REMOODAT (RMOD), this enables you to create your own weapons and custom
ammunition types. I also implemented the Beta BFG, also known as the
BFG2074(?) or BFG2704(?), but it is also the own that looked like Christmas.
As such, the current weapon shoots red and green fireballs so it really does
look more like it. After this, my next target is getting actual map objects
and such moved to REMOODAT so that you can create as many new objects as
memory permits.

Besides that, I also implemented console history (you can go back and execute
commands). I added some new console commands that allow you to cheat in the
game (testing for me personally) and to change game settings. Unlike Doom
Legacy, I decided to fork off the game settings away from the console code so
I can remove the bloat there. Also the new setting manager is capable of
selecting demo versions and is in a single spot. Since it is in the same spot,
it can easily be added into save games and networking in the future so that
game settings are not just a hack on the console code.

On a note of demo compatibility, the new variable code enables older demos to
be supported better so that you could possibly watch a demo from Doom Legacy
1.11 (the first version of Legacy) and such. Although you cannot play or
record demos currently, it will make things easier to support them now.
