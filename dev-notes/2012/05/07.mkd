I've made numerous changes over the last month, the more pressing ones i've
explained in more detail. Some minor changes include an OPL emulator from
Chocolate Doom (although it cannot make any noise), Generalized LineDef Types
(LineDef specials defined in a lump), replaced non-free dsjump/dsouch with
free versions, extra resolutions, initial bot support, joystick control,
better profiles, cluster spawning, console history, Beta BFG, and some more
things.

I have also added a loading screen indicator for when levels load to indicate
how far along levels have been loaded. This is to show at least some progress
rather than indicating nothing. Note that the loading screen will not appear
for the first 2 seconds of map loading, after that point it appears. I do this
because drawing the loading screen costs time and the time could be spent
loading the level rather than drawing.

I also got plans down for a new intermission layout as seen below. It should
be rather simple and show information for more than a few players. Any
scoreboards will probably look the same and could share the same code.

I have also brought the video initialization code to the near start of the
game to inform the user that the game is loading (since it takes a bit longer
due to all of the dynamic data being loaded). The single line message informs
the user of what is happening (in this case it is loading objects). The red
piece on the bar moves around to indicate activity.

I am currently working on the save game code so that you will be able to save
and load games. The save games are made in a way so it should feel like you
never even stopped playing.

As a small fun thing to do, you can play as a monster, although you move like
a monster.
