Networking now works and you can play with others. Pretty much most of the
work that has been done has been with the core networking code. Note that if
you do play with others, it will be a bit laggy. Recommended one uses the
command line to host servers with -host, and others connect with -connect. It
has not been long since my last update, only half a month, so there have not
been many changes. Hopefully soon I can create the master server and make the
game nicely playable on any connection.

Here is a list of things I have done with the code:

  * MIDI on Windows now. 
  * Fix remood.wad building on Windows/DOS. 
  * Console can now access variables and game variables plainly. 
  * Minor menu work. 
  * In game chatting, note that macros are not implemented yet.
