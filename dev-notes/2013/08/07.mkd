Have not made any updates in quite some months, but I pretty much did an
entire rework of the old networking code (as it got rather messy). However
this new code is faster and more efficient. So if you ever did have a chance
to test the old code out, you would find this much improved. With the old
code, it was really slow and extremely laggy. You would get spurious lag
spikes which would exponentially increase until you got kicked out of the
game.
