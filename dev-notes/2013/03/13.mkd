I have worked on networking the past month, which means you can currently
somewhat play with others. Some things are still missing, such as clients
moving, and uploading/downloading WAD files, adding new split screens in game.
Along with networking save games work, loading and saving. Save games in
ReMooD are planned to be perfect, so that when you save the game it is exactly
how you left it. Currently the entire state is not saved, but a huge chunk of
it is.

However, the menus have no changed a bit at all, so most of the game usage is
via command line or via console.

Bots have been partialy coded, they can partially run around a level to a
certain extent.

Here is a list of things I have done with the code:

  * The line type functions have been simplified for implementation sake. 
  * Save games, partial data is saved. 
  * Work on bots and their navigation. 
  * Misc. Code Cleanups. 
  * Switch to a game mode setup, Coop, DM, CTF, etc. 
  * MIDI music can be played on Linux with ALSA.
