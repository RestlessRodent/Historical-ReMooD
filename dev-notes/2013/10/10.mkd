For those that have been checking the automated builds, you may have noticed
that ReMooD was a bit unplayable. I've decided on partially reverting the
changes I have made. My changes were not lost, just they are hidden. Since I
am rather busy, it would be better if ReMooD was at least playable to an
extent rather than being unplayable with major overhauls in effect.
